- Semantic Versioning: <https://semver.org>

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Split API documentation into module pages to avoid slow rendering of generated binding packages.

### Added

- Add automated release PRs, verified PyPI publishing, PR build/test/documentation
  checks, Codecov reports, and Read the Docs configuration.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Add structured XML validation, offline local schema support, and detailed
  diagnostics for XML and schema failures.
- Add source-preserving choice enumeration operations and prefix-independent
  document identification across supported SPIRIT/IP-XACT versions.
- Add explicit offline schema validation with local Accellera schemas and detailed
  XSD diagnostics, including source locations and structured schema-load failures.
- Add Markdown lint configuration and normalize repository documentation formatting.
- new persistent xml registration `register` with `scan`, and `list` subcommands.
- add registry loader and scanner for IP-XACT XML files, enhance VLNV management
- Expand the categorized feature checklist to track all planned capabilities and all 2,469 TGI operation entries,
  distinguishing verified work from outstanding work.
- Add the bus-definition extended-VLNV accessor and feature implementation checklist.

### Fixed

- Preserve the QName of empty generic bus-interface choices during XML round trips.
- Update catalog TGI URI construction and test fixtures for regenerated keyword-only models.
- Verify rejection of experimental IPXACT/2.0 files included in upstream examples.
- Return structured validation failures for missing and malformed XML documents.
- Identify SPIRIT/IP-XACT documents from the expanded root namespace, supporting
  default and arbitrary prefixes; reject unsupported versions and allow retry
  after failed identification.
- Repair choice enumeration creation, source-expression access and parent ownership
  for new and parsed children; reject invalid removal handles.
- Align bus capability setters and optional broadcast/extends removers with Annex F argument names; reject non-Boolean
  capability values without changing documents.
- Align bus-definition extends and choice inputs with Annex F; preserve choice enumerations and correct
  choice/system-group ownership during removal.

### Changed

- Regenerate Accellera bindings with keyword-only models and required fields.
- Require Python 3.14 and refresh locked dependencies and CI setup.
